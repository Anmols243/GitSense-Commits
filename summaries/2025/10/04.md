The log details changes to a single file, `e:\AI ml\Machine learning\Projects\House-price-predictor\Housing.csv`. This file contains tabular data, likely a dataset for a house price prediction project, given its path and content structure.

The file's content, consisting of a header row and numerous data rows, remained identical across all recorded timestamps:
*   10/4/2025, 4:59:51 PM
*   10/4/2025, 5:00:01 PM
*   10/4/2025, 5:11:33 PM

This indicates that while the file was accessed or its state logged multiple times, no actual modifications to its content were made between these timestamps.

The content itself is structured as comma-separated values, with a header defining attributes such as `price`, `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `parking`, `prefarea`, and `furnishingstatus`. Data rows follow this format, featuring a mix of numerical values (e.g., price, area, bedroom count) and categorical values (e.g., 'yes/no' for amenities, 'furnished/semi-furnished/unfurnished' for furnishing status).
