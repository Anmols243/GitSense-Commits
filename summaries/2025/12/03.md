# Activity Summary for 12/3/2025

## 10:38:10 PM
The development log details the setup and configuration of a CrewAI application designed to research YouTube videos and generate blog posts. All recorded changes occurred on 12/3/2025, between 9:39:50 PM and 10:36:25 PM, indicating a focused development session.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`requirements.txt`**: This file was initialized with `crewai` and `crewai_tools`, and later updated to include `langchain-groq`, signifying the adoption of a Groq-based Large Language Model.
*   **`tools.py`**: A `YoutubeChannelSearchTool` named `yt_tool` was created, configured to search the YouTube channel `@krishnaik06`. This tool was subsequently updated to utilize the `groq_llm` for its operations.
*   **`llm.py`**: A new file was introduced to define and configure the language model. It imports `ChatGroq` from `langchain_groq`, loads environment variables to access the `GROQ_API_KEY`, and initializes `groq_llm` using the "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" model with a temperature of 0.2.
*   **`agents.py`**: Two agents were defined:
    *   `blog_researcher`: Role set as 'Blog Researcher from Youtube Videos', with the goal to 'get the relevant video content for the topic{topic} from youtube channel'. Its backstory describes expertise in AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Gen AI.
    *   `blog_writer`: Role set as 'Blog Writer', with the goal to 'Narrate compelling tech stories about the video {topic} from youtube channel'. Its backstory highlights a flair for simplifying complex topics.
    Initially, both agents were defined, then updated to include the `yt_tool`. Subsequently, `groq_llm` was integrated into both agents by assigning it to their `llm` parameter, and the `memory` parameter was removed from their initial definitions.
*   **`tasks.py`**: Two tasks were created:
    *   `research_task`: Assigned to the `blog_researcher`, it aims to identify and gather detailed information about a video topic, expecting a 3-paragraph report.
    *   `write_task`: Assigned to the `blog_writer`, this task focuses on summarizing YouTube video information and creating blog content, with the output directed to `new-blog-post.md`.
    Minor corrections were made to the import path for `Task` (from `crewai` to `crewai.task`), and the expected output for the `write_task` was refined to explicitly include blog content creation.
*   **`crew.py`**: This file sets up and executes the CrewAI workflow. It imports the defined agents and tasks, then initializes a `Crew` object. The crew is configured to use `Process.sequential` for task execution. Initially, parameters like `memory`, `cache`, `max_rpm`, and `share_crew` were included but later removed. The `Crew` was set to `verbose=True`. The `kickoff()` method was added to start the crew's work, providing an input `topic` (e.g., 'AI VS ML VS ML VS Data Science') and printing the final result. Import paths for `Crew` and `Process` were also refined from top-level `crewai` imports to specific module imports (`crewai.crew` and `crewai.process`).

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

A consistent pattern across the log is the modular development approach, separating concerns into `agents`, `tools`, `tasks`, `llm`, and `crew` modules. The evolution of the code shows an iterative process of defining core components, then integrating them, and finally refining their parameters and execution flow. A key recurring theme is the integration of the `yt_tool` and, more significantly, the `groq_llm` across the agents and tools, demonstrating a shift towards utilizing a specific language model for enhanced capabilities. The constant refinement of import statements (e.g., `crewai` to `crewai.agent` or `crewai.crew`) indicates adjustments to the CrewAI library's module structure during development.
