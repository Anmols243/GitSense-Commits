# Activity Summary for 12/6/2025

## 7:45:07 PM
The provided log details changes across two distinct Python applications and their associated documentation, all timestamped on 12/6/2025, indicating a focused development session.

**File: `e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\app.py`**
*   **Timestamp:** 12/6/2025, 6:45:42 PM
*   This file represents a Streamlit application designed for multi-language invoice extraction and natural language Q&A.
*   It utilizes `dotenv` for configuration and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with the `gemini-2.5-pro` model for AI capabilities.
*   Key functionalities include:
    *   Defining detailed `System_Extration_rules` to guide the AI in extracting specific invoice fields (e.g., invoice number, vendor details, line items) into a strict JSON format, with rules for omission of unfound or empty fields.
    *   Implementing `pdf_to_image_b64` and `file_bytes` functions to handle various image types (JPG, PNG, WEBP) and convert PDFs (using `pdf2image` and a specified Poppler path) into base64 encoded images for AI processing.
    *   `get_response` dynamically selects between the extraction rules or a general invoice understanding prompt based on user input, and constructs messages for the multimodal Gemini model, including the image.
    *   A `clean_json_output` function is present to strip markdown code blocks from the AI's response before JSON parsing.
*   The Streamlit UI facilitates uploading invoice files, inputting queries, and displaying the parsed JSON output (with a download option) or raw model output if parsing fails.

**File: `e:\AI ml\Gemini\QnA_chat_app\app.py`**
*   **Timestamp:** 12/6/2025, 6:45:58 PM
*   This is a simpler Streamlit application focused on general Q&A using the Gemini model.
*   It also uses `dotenv` and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (gemini-2.5-pro).
*   The `get_response` function directly invokes the Gemini model with a user's question.
*   The Streamlit interface provides a text input for questions and displays the AI's response. This application appears to be a basic demonstration of integrating Gemini for conversational AI.

**File: `e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\readme.md`**
*   **Timestamp:** 12/6/2025, 6:58:43 PM
*   This documentation file provides a comprehensive overview of the `MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor` project.
*   It outlines the project's features, including structured invoice extraction, natural language Q&A, PDF support, multilingual input, and downloadable output.
*   The `Tech Stack` section confirms the use of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Vision, Streamlit, LangChain 1.x, `pdf2image`, PIL, and `python-dotenv`.
*   Detailed installation instructions are provided, covering repository cloning, virtual environment setup, dependency installation (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), API key configuration via a `.env` file (`GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`), and specific steps for Poppler installation on Windows.
*   It includes a `How It Works` overview explaining the data flow from user upload through Gemini processing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Both applications consistently leverage the `gemini-2.5-pro` model, indicating a reliance on Google's advanced multimodal AI capabilities.
*   **Streamlit:** The choice of Streamlit for the user interface across both `app.py` files highlights a preference for rapidly building interactive web applications for AI demonstrations.
*   **LangChain:** The `langchain_google_genai` integration demonstrates the use of LangChain as a framework for interacting with LLMs, providing structured ways to manage prompts and model calls.
*   **`python-dotenv`:** The use of `dotenv` in both Python applications and its mention in the `readme.md` indicates a standard practice for managing environment variables, particularly for API keys.
*   **Base64 Encoding:** For multimodal input, image data (including converted PDFs) is consistently encoded in base64 before being sent to the AI model.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** All log entries are very close in time (within ~15 minutes), suggesting that these changes were part of a single, concentrated development or commit effort on December 6, 2025.
*   **Invoice Focus:** The `MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor` project is the more complex and featured application, showcasing practical application of multimodal AI for business document processing.

## 8:45:04 PM
The log details development across two distinct Streamlit applications, both leveraging the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro model. All recorded changes occurred on 12/6/2025, indicating a focused period of activity, primarily between 6:45 PM and 6:58 PM.

**e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\app.py (Timestamp: 12/6/2025, 6:45:42 PM)**
This file defines a comprehensive Streamlit application designed for multi-language invoice extraction and Q&A.
*   **Core Functionality:** Utilizes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with `gemini-2.5-pro`. It supports both structured invoice data extraction (via a detailed JSON schema with specific rules for inclusion/exclusion) and general natural-language Q&A based on invoice content.
*   **Image Processing:** Handles image files (JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP) directly and PDF files by converting their first page to a PNG image using `pdf2image` (requires Poppler). All images are then base64 encoded for transmission to the LLM.
*   **System Prompts:** Dynamically selects between a strict `System_Extration_rules` prompt (for extraction queries) and a `base_system_instruction` (for general Q&A).
*   **Output Handling:** Cleans LLM output by removing markdown code blocks (`clean_json_output`). It attempts to parse the response as JSON and displays it in a structured format, offering a download button for the JSON data. If parsing fails, it displays the raw model output.
*   **User Interface:** Features a Streamlit interface for uploading invoice files and entering queries. It provides immediate feedback on upload status (image preview or PDF info).

**e:\AI ml\Gemini\QnA_chat_app\app.py (Timestamp: 12/6/2025, 6:45:58 PM)**
This file outlines a simpler Streamlit application focused on basic Q&A using the Gemini model.
*   **Core Functionality:** Sets up a `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` instance using `gemini-2.5-pro`. It takes a user question and directly invokes the model to get a response.
*   **User Interface:** A straightforward Streamlit app with a header, text input field for the question, a submit button, and a dedicated section to display the model's response.

**e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\readme.md (Timestamp: 12/6/2025, 6:58:43 PM)**
This document provides extensive details about the `MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor` project.
*   **Features:** Highlights structured JSON output for invoice details, natural-language Q&A, PDF support, multilingual input, and downloadable outputs (JSON/raw).
*   **Tech Stack:** Clearly lists `Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Vision` as the LLM, `Streamlit` for the UI, `LangChain` as the LLM framework, `pdf2image` and `PIL` for file processing, and `python-dotenv` for configuration.
*   **Installation & Setup:** Provides step-by-step instructions for cloning, virtual environment setup, dependency installation (`requirements.txt`), API key configuration (`.env` file), and critical Poppler installation for Windows users.
*   **Project Structure:** Outlines key files including `app.py`, `.env`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`.
*   **How It Works:** Explains the flow from user upload to base64 conversion, LangChain integration with Gemini, and app display/download.
*   **Use Cases:** Lists practical applications like automated data scraping, bookkeeping, and multilingual interpretation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration:** Both `app.py` files consistently use `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with the `gemini-2.5-pro` model, indicating a reliance on this specific LLM for their core logic.
*   **Streamlit Framework:** Both applications are built using `streamlit`, providing web-based user interfaces.
*   **`python-dotenv` Usage:** Both `app.py` files load environment variables using `load_dotenv()`, suggesting that API keys or other sensitive configurations are managed outside the codebase. This is explicitly confirmed in the `readme.md`.
*   **Timestamps:** All changes are very close in time (within ~13 minutes on the same day), suggesting initial setup, rapid prototyping, or a single development session.
