The provided log details changes across two distinct Python applications and their associated documentation, all timestamped on 12/6/2025, indicating a focused development session.

**File: `e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\app.py`**
*   **Timestamp:** 12/6/2025, 6:45:42 PM
*   This file represents a Streamlit application designed for multi-language invoice extraction and natural language Q&A.
*   It utilizes `dotenv` for configuration and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with the `gemini-2.5-pro` model for AI capabilities.
*   Key functionalities include:
    *   Defining detailed `System_Extration_rules` to guide the AI in extracting specific invoice fields (e.g., invoice number, vendor details, line items) into a strict JSON format, with rules for omission of unfound or empty fields.
    *   Implementing `pdf_to_image_b64` and `file_bytes` functions to handle various image types (JPG, PNG, WEBP) and convert PDFs (using `pdf2image` and a specified Poppler path) into base64 encoded images for AI processing.
    *   `get_response` dynamically selects between the extraction rules or a general invoice understanding prompt based on user input, and constructs messages for the multimodal Gemini model, including the image.
    *   A `clean_json_output` function is present to strip markdown code blocks from the AI's response before JSON parsing.
*   The Streamlit UI facilitates uploading invoice files, inputting queries, and displaying the parsed JSON output (with a download option) or raw model output if parsing fails.

**File: `e:\AI ml\Gemini\QnA_chat_app\app.py`**
*   **Timestamp:** 12/6/2025, 6:45:58 PM
*   This is a simpler Streamlit application focused on general Q&A using the Gemini model.
*   It also uses `dotenv` and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (gemini-2.5-pro).
*   The `get_response` function directly invokes the Gemini model with a user's question.
*   The Streamlit interface provides a text input for questions and displays the AI's response. This application appears to be a basic demonstration of integrating Gemini for conversational AI.

## 8:45:04 PM
The log details development across two distinct Streamlit applications, both leveraging the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro model. All recorded changes occurred on 12/6/2025, indicating a focused period of activity, primarily between 6:45 PM and 6:58 PM.

**e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\app.py (Timestamp: 12/6/2025, 6:45:42 PM)**
This file defines a comprehensive Streamlit application designed for multi-language invoice extraction and Q&A.
*   **Core Functionality:** Utilizes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with `gemini-2.5-pro`. It supports both structured invoice data extraction (via a detailed JSON schema with specific rules for inclusion/exclusion) and general natural-language Q&A based on invoice content.
*   **Image Processing:** Handles image files (JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP) directly and PDF files by converting their first page to a PNG image using `pdf2image` (requires Poppler). All images are then base64 encoded for transmission to the LLM.
*   **System Prompts:** Dynamically selects between a strict `System_Extration_rules` prompt (for extraction queries) and a `base_system_instruction` (for general Q&A).
*   **Output Handling:** Cleans LLM output by removing markdown code blocks (`clean_json_output`). It attempts to parse the response as JSON and displays it in a structured format, offering a download button for the JSON data. If parsing fails, it displays the raw model output.
*   **User Interface:** Features a Streamlit interface for uploading invoice files and entering queries. It provides immediate feedback on upload status (image preview or PDF info).

**e:\AI ml\Gemini\QnA_chat_app\app.py (Timestamp: 12/6/2025, 6:45:58 PM)**
This file outlines a simpler Streamlit application focused on basic Q&A using the Gemini model.
*   **Core Functionality:** Sets up a `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` instance using `gemini-2.5-pro`. It takes a user question and directly invokes the model to get a response.
*   **User Interface:** A straightforward Streamlit app with a header, text input field for the question, a submit button, and a dedicated section to display the model's response.

**e:\AI ml\Gemini\MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor\readme.md (Timestamp: 12/6/2025, 6:58:43 PM)**
This document provides extensive details about the `MultiLang_Invoice_Extractor` project.
