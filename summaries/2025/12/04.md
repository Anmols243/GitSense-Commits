# Activity Summary for 12/4/2025

## 8:28:30 PM
The `requirements.txt` file underwent several updates. Initially, on 12/4/2025 at 7:29:53 PM, the file was empty. A significant change occurred shortly after at 7:30:22 PM, when the file was populated with `streamlit`, `google-generativeai`, and `python-dotenv`. Later, on 12/4/2025 at 8:27:21 PM, a minor correction was made, changing `python-dotenv` to `dotenv`, while `streamlit` and `google-generativeai` remained consistent. The primary pattern observed is the progressive definition and refinement of project dependencies.
