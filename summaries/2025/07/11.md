# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 5:55:38 PM
The `tracker.py` file underwent several revisions on July 11, 2025.  Initially, it was a simple cryptocurrency price tracker fetching data from CoinGecko API.  The core logic remained consistent throughout the changes, focusing on fetching cryptocurrency prices, handling API rate limits and errors, and printing updated prices to the console.  Color output using the `colorama` library was used to display updates and errors.

The first significant change (around 5:07 PM) involved adding the `os` module to the imports, though its functionality wasn't immediately utilized. Subsequent changes (5:08 PM - 5:09 PM) introduced a `log_filename` variable, initially assigned "crypto_pr", then corrected to "crypto_price_log.csv", to prepare for logging functionality.  The `os.path.isfile` function was added to check for the log file's existence (around 5:08 PM).

A major update occurred at 5:13 PM.  The code was modified to write price data to the "crypto_price_log.csv" file using the `csv` module.  The file is created if it doesn't exist, and a header row ("Timestamp", "Coin", "Price", "Currency") is written. Subsequent writes append new price data to the file.  There were minor repeated edits after this point.

At approximately 5:31 PM, a new command-line argument `-s` or `--save` was added to allow users to specify a custom filename for the log file.  The default remains "crypto_price_log.csv".  There was a brief period of accidental duplication of the `--currency` argument which was immediately corrected.

Finally, the `.gitignore` file was modified to exclude the generated `crypto_price_log.csv` from version control, ensuring that only the code is tracked, not the constantly changing data files.  The  `.gitignore` was initially incorrectly written as `*.csv .crypto_price_log.csv` (5:23:08 PM) then was corrected as `*.csv crypto_price_log.csv` (5:23:37 PM).
