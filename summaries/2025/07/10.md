# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 7:00:14 PM
The log shows numerous edits to the `tracker.py` file, all focused on improving a cryptocurrency price tracker.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: fetching cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API, handling rate limits and network errors, and displaying the results in a color-coded format.

Early revisions (6:02 PM) focused on basic error handling and using a dictionary (`last_price`) to track price changes.  A key change around 6:02:41 PM was switching from a dictionary to a `set` for `invalid_coins`, improving efficiency.  Further refinements between 6:04 PM and 6:06 PM involved conditional logic to avoid unnecessary API calls when a coin's data was already present in `last_price`.  There were several minor attempts to optimize the logic around handling invalid or missing coins.

A significant revision occurred around 6:06 PM, where the program began ignoring invalid coins entirely instead of repeatedly checking. This is done by checking the `invalid_coins` set before processing each coin.  The subsequent changes further refined this error handling, ensuring that invalid coins are added to the `invalid_coins` set under all appropriate conditions.  

The most substantial change happened around 6:32 PM. A docstring was added providing a description of the script's purpose.  Further minor adjustments between 6:32 PM and 6:37 PM refined the error handling, particularly for handling cases where `coin_data` or `price` might be `None`.   The final version (6:43 PM) maintained the improved error handling and logic, showing a stable and improved script.  The consistent use of `coin.upper()` for output formatting suggests attention to detail in display presentation.  Throughout, the update frequency was adjusted, settling on a 15-second interval.
